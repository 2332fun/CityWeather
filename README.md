# City Weather

## Description

What: My motivation for this project was to provide a quick weather report of key information regarding the user's cities of preference. My efforts have allowed the user to type in their city and see results using OneCall and Current Weather API. I learned how to implement 2 similar APIs to pull the weather data. My project should stand out as efficient in displaying the wanted information.
